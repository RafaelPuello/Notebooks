# Data Analysis Portfolio
I created this repository as a way to demonstrate some of my data analysis projects.  I'm currently reading [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) and plan to complete different projects using the methods outlined in the book.  The projects will be written in either Python, SAS, or R and displayed in a Jupyter notebook document.

### Regression
___
* [Exploring Life Expectancy](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RafaelPuello/Notebooks/blob/master/LifeExpectancy.ipynb) - In this project I use Python to perform some data cleaning and regression analysis to explore the relationship between Life Expectancy and various predictor variables.

### Forecasting
___
* [Forecasting Retail Turnover](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RafaelPuello/Notebooks/blob/master/RetailTurnover.ipynb) - In this project I use SAS to build and compare various models for forecasting retail turnover.

### Classification
